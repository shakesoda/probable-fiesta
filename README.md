it's a compiler for a language I'm making up as I go. features I will close your issues about include off-side rule, no semicolons, tabs-only, and a reckless disregard for type and memory safety.

currently lexing works and parsing is started, no codegen yet but some native targets (ARM, x86_64) and maybe C and LLVM are planned.
